Ye Xiu ends up finding work as a night-shift manager at Happy Internet Cafe, where he meets Chen Guo, the owner of the cafe whom happens to be a huge fan of his alias 'Ye Qiu', his former team and character 'One Autumn Leaf'. While awaiting his return to the competitive scene, Ye Xiu continues playing the game, building a character from scratch and pursuing the championship and glory.`,\r\n                        summary_2: ``\r\n                    },\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n.summary {\r\n    font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\r\n    font-size: 20px\r\n}\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AnimeData.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AnimeData.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./AnimeData.vue?vue&type=template&id=73055e61&\"\nimport script from \"./AnimeData.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./AnimeData.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./AnimeData.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=73055e61&prod&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports\n\n/* vuetify-loader */\nimport installComponents from \"!../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/runtime/installComponents.js\"\nimport { VCard } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VCard';\nimport { VCol } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VGrid';\nimport { VDivider } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VDivider';\nimport { VImg } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VImg';\nimport { VMain } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VMain';\nimport { VRow } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VGrid';\ninstallComponents(component, {VCard,VCol,VDivider,VImg,VMain,VRow})\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/berserk.52074774.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/black-clover.14b142e7.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/hunterxhunter.48035c22.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/one-punch-man.8fba2a66.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/demon-slayer.969a3c82.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/kings-avatar.979bf989.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/no-game-no-life.e1685ef6.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/overlord.ed5fde14.jpg\";","// Styles\nimport './VMain.sass'\n\n// Mixins\nimport SSRBootable from '../../mixins/ssr-bootable'\n\n// Types\nimport { VNode } from 'vue'\n\n/* @vue/component */\nexport default SSRBootable.extend({\n  name: 'v-main',\n\n  props: {\n    tag: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'main',\n    },\n  },\n\n  computed: {\n    styles (): object {\n      const {\n        bar, top, right, footer, insetFooter, bottom, left,\n      } = this.$vuetify.application\n\n      return {\n        paddingTop: `${top + bar}px`,\n        paddingRight: `${right}px`,\n        paddingBottom: `${footer + insetFooter + bottom}px`,\n        paddingLeft: `${left}px`,\n      }\n    },\n  },\n\n  render (h): VNode {\n    const data = {\n      staticClass: 'v-main',\n      style: this.styles,\n      ref: 'main',\n    }\n\n    return h(this.tag, data, [\n      h(\n        'div',\n        { staticClass: 'v-main__wrap' },\n        this.$slots.default\n      ),\n    ])\n  },\n})\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/sword-art-online.1a4b4f9a.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
